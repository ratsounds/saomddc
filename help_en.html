<h2>Current Ranking Events</h2>

<p>Use ranking event hashtags and template to improve search capability when movies and strategies. I suggest
    to use following template (I plan to make a tool based on this template).</p>
<p class="math">#メモデフ #saomd #<var>ranking event hashtag</var><var>time sec</var><var>char info</var><var>comment</var></p>
<p class="math"><var>charinfo</var>=<var>char.lv</var><var>gacha</var><var>nick</var>R<var>wep.lv</var>+<var>char.lv</var>...</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<div class="sample">
    <p>#メモデフ #saomd #FairylandRanking2nd 20s</p>
    <p>80 PYui R4+100 OSAsuna R5+100 HR Kirito R5</p>
    <p>yui-chan is soooooo cute.</p>

<p>The seach capability will improve if you use char and gacha names from below-mentioned lists.</p>

<h2>Damage Calculation</h2>
<p>In Memory Defrag, Damage can be calculated following simple eqation but real in-game damage has variance
    in 10% for max damage.</p>
<p class="math">
    <var>Damage</var><b>=</b><b>(</b><var>Attack</var><b>-</b><var>Defence</var><b>)</b><b>×</b><var>Skill Rate</var><b>×</b><var>Modifier</var>
</p>
<p>where <var>Attack</var> can be defined as follows</p>
<p class="math">
    <var>Attack</var><b>=</b><b>(</b><var>Base Attack</var><b>+</b><var>Skill Slot</var><b>)</b><b>×</b><b>(</b><b>1</b><b>+</b><b>Σ</b><var>Battle Skill</var><b>)</b><b>×</b><var>Buff</var>
</p>
<p class="math">
    <var>Base Attack</var><b>=</b><var>Character Attack</var><b>+</b><var>Weapon Attack</var>
</p>
<p>Attack+ of Skill Slot gave the effect of Battle Skill and Buff becase <var>Skill Slot</var> is added before
    multiplication of Battle Skill and Buff.</p>
<p>Each boss has own <var>Defence</var> that is 1450 in many cases for ranking event. Defence can be calculated
    by following eqation considering debuff.</p>
<p class="math">
    <var>Defence</var><b>=</b><var>Boss Defence</var><b>×</b><var>Debuff</var>
</p>
<p><var>Skill Rate</var> is important hidden parameter to define damage output. Skill rate is different in each
    skill and normal attack.</p>
<p>Finally, given basic damage is modified by elementals and weapon types </p>
<p class="math">
    <var>Modifier</var><b>=</b><var>Critical</var><b>×</b><var>Elemental</var><b>×</b><var>Weapon Type</var>
</p>
<p><var>Critical</var>is basicaly 1.5. Some character, such as new water characters, has battle skill to improve
    them.
</p>
<p><var>Elemental</var> and <var>Weapon Type</var> are modifiers for weak points that are defined for each boss.
    Normally, these modifier is 1.5 in "Weak" and 0.75 in "Resist". Note that weapon type modifier is basicaly
    determined by character's weapon type but few character has sword skill with different weapon type. For
    simple example, OS Asuna's S3 is slash type and OS Shinon's S3 is magic type. For more complex exmaple,
    V Leafa's S3 has slash type part and magic type part.</p>
<p>The final damage gave two or more weak point modifier. However, <var>Modifier</var>is limited smaller than
    <var>Critical</var>x2.</p>
<h2>How to get Defence</h2>
<p>
    <var>Defence</var> can be estimated from the damage in character with <var>Modifier</var>=1 because the
    skill rate of first hit in the rapier and sword normal attack is 0.5. Because damage has variance in
    10%, take the max value or take the mean value or median and devide them by 0.95 for error reduction.
    For more detailed sampling, <var>Defence</var> can be get without error by watching out the character
    with <var>0</var>&lt;<var>Attack</var>-<var>Defence</var>&lt;<var>1</var> because damage will be 1 in
    skill rate &lt; 1 and 2 or more in skill rate &gt; 1
</p>
<h2>How to get Modifier</h2>
<p>The modifiers of elements and weapon types have to be measured due to the difference in enemies. Modifier
    can be determined from damage rate between observations and estimate damage under known <var>defence</var>.
    When boss has 2 or more weak points, modifiers should be detemined separately for each weak point becose
    the logic under dual weakness is unclarified.</p>
<h2>How to get Skill Rate from Test Goblin</h2>
<p><var>Skill Rate</var> can be estimated from Test Goblin since it has 1450 defence. So you can know damage
    specs before lottery:3 Note that the characters in test stage has all battle skills and all skill slots
    but thier sowrd skills are lv1. The lv2 sword skills commonly has 1.1 times values on <var>Skill Rate</var>                    and 0.5 times <var>Buff</var>.</p>
<h2>How to get Attack Buff</h2>
<p><var>Buff</var> have to be estimated based on damage calculation expression because the effect of attak buff
    could not be calculated from simple damage rate. For example in S3 has attack buff, you have to solve
    the simultaneous equation for <var>Buff</var> and <var>Skill Rate</var> from the observations of S1 or
    S2 on buffed and non-buffed.</p>
